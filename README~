This package is an implementation of 1 dimensional error corrected Gaussian Mixture model in C++ and python. To speed up the calculation, the key part of the code is a C++ class, ecGMMClass.h, which implements the ECGMM iterations.

There are 3 subdirectories: src, bin and py. 
In src, there are 4 files:

ecGMMClass.h: the C++ class that implement the EM iterations.
ecGMMexample.cpp: an example C++ code showing how to use the ecGMMClass.h class.
   
ecgmm.h: Two functions defined based on ecGMMClass.h. They both calculate the mixture model parameters but one return the BIC and another return AIC.   
ecgmm.i


The usage of this class is shown in the ecGMMexample.cpp. The example file can be compiled by typing make.
